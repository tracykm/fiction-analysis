And he was a high-spirited man, quick to anger, a passionate man. \u201cAnd your mother, she was passionate too. Not so well born as him, but a clever woman. A Scholar, even, and those who saw her said she was very beautiful. She and your father, they fell in love as soon\u2019s they met. \u201cThe trouble was, your mother was already married. She\u2019d married a politician. He was a member of the king\u2019s party, one of his closest advisers. A rising man. \u201cNow when your mother found herself with child, she feared to tell her husband the child wasn\u2019t his. And when the baby was born\u2014that\u2019s you, girl\u2014it was clear from the look of you that you didn\u2019t favor her husband, but your true father, and she thought it best to hide you away and give out that you\u2019d died.  \u201cSo you was took to Oxfordshire, where your father had estates, and put in the care of a gyptian woman to nurse. But someone whispered to your mother\u2019s husband what had happened, and he came a flying down and ransacked the cottage where the gyptian woman had been, only she\u2019d fled to the great house; and the husband followed after, in a murderous passion. \u201cLord Asriel was out a hunting, but they got word to him and he came riding back in time to find your mother\u2019s husband at the foot of the great staircase. Another moment and he\u2019d have forced open the closet where the gyptian woman was hiding with you, but Lord Asriel challenged him, and they fought there and then, and Lord Asriel killed him. \u201cThe gyptian woman heard and saw it all, Lyra, and that\u2019s how we know. \u201cThe consequence was a great lawsuit. Your father en\u2019t the kind of man to deny or conceal the truth, and it left the judges with a problem. He\u2019d killed all right, he\u2019d shed blood, but he was defending his home and his child against an intruder. On t\u2019other hand, the law allows any man to avenge the violation of his wife, and the dead man\u2019s lawyers argued that he were doing just that. \u201cThe case lasted for weeks, with volumes of argument back and forth. In the end the judges punished Lord Asriel by confiscating all his property and all his land, and left him a poor man; and he had been richer than a king. \u201cAs for your mother, she wanted nothing to do with it, nor with you. She turned her back. The gyptian nurse told me she\u2019d often been afeared of how your mother would treat you, because she was a proud and scornful woman. So much for her. \u201cThen there was you. If things had fallen out different, Lyra, you might have been brought up a gyptian, because the nurse begged the court to let her have you; but we gyptians got little standing in the law. The court decided you was to be placed in a priory, and so you were, with the Sisters of Obedience at Watlington. You won\u2019t remember. \u201cBut Lord Asriel wouldn\u2019t stand for that. He had a hatred of priors and monks and nuns, and being a high-handed man he just rode in one day and carried you off. Not to look after himself, nor to give to the gyptians; he took you to Jordan College, and dared the law to undo it. \u201cWell, the law let things be. Lord Asriel went back to his explorations, and you grew up at Jordan College. The one thing he said, your father, the one condition he made, was that your mother shouldn\u2019t be let see you. If she ever tried to do that, she was to be prevented, and he was to be told, because all the anger in his nature had turned against her now. The Master promised faithfully to do that; and so time passed. \u201cThen come all this anxiety about Dust. And all over the country, all over the world, wise men and women too began a worrying about it. It weren\u2019t of any account to us gyptians, until they started taking our kids. That\u2019s when we got interested. And we got connections in all sorts of places you wouldn\u2019t imagine, including Jordan College. You wouldn\u2019t know, but there\u2019s been someone a watching over you and reporting to us ever since you been there. \u2019Cause we got an interest in you, and that gyptian woman who nursed you, she never stopped being anxious on your behalf.\u201d",

The Master was given a charge by Lord Asriel to look after you and keep you safe from your mother. And that was what he did, for ten years or more. Then Mrs. Coulter\u2019s friends in the Church helped her set up this Oblation Board, for what purpose we don\u2019t know, and there she was, as powerful in her way as Lord Asriel was in his. Your parents, both strong in the world, both ambitious, and the Master of Jordan holding you in the balance between them. \u201cNow the Master\u2019s got a hundred things to look after. His first concern is his College and the scholarship there. So if he sees a threat to that, he has to move agin it. And the Church in recent times, Lyra, it\u2019s been a getting more commanding. There\u2019s councils for this and councils for that; there\u2019s talk of reviving the Office of Inquisition, God forbid. And the Master has to tread warily between all these powers. He has to keep Jordan  College on the right side of the Church, or it won\u2019t survive. \u201cAnd another concern of the Master is you, child. Bernie Johansen was always clear about that. The Master of Jordan and the other Scholars, they loved you like their own child. They\u2019d do anything to keep you safe, not just because they\u2019d promised to Lord Asriel that they would, but for your own sake. So if the Master gave you up to Mrs. Coulter when he\u2019d promised Lord Asriel he wouldn\u2019t, he must have thought you\u2019d be safer with her than in Jordan College, in spite of all appearances. And when he set out to poison Lord Asriel, he must have thought that what Lord Asriel was a doing would place all of them in danger, and maybe all of us, too; maybe all the world. I see the Master as a man having terrible choices to make; whatever he chooses will do harm, but maybe if he does the right thing, a little less harm will come about than if he chooses wrong. God preserve me from having to make that sort of choice. \u201cAnd when it come to the point where he had to let you go, he gave you the symbol reader and bade you keep it safe.

    "sentence": "\u201cI\u2019ll begin. My name, as I told you, is Parry, and I was not born in this world. Lord Asriel is not the first by any means to travel between the worlds, though he\u2019s the first to open the way so spectacularly. In my own world I was a soldier and then an explorer. Twelve years ago I was accompanying an expedition to a place in my world that corresponds with your Beringland. My companions had other intentions, but I was looking for something I\u2019d heard about from old legends: a rent in the fabric of the world, a hole that had appeared between our universe and another. Well, some of my companions got lost. In searching for them, I and two others walked through this hole, this doorway, without even seeing it, and left our world altogether. At first we didn\u2019t realize what had happened. We walked on till we found a town, and then there was no mistaking it: we were in a different world. \u201cWell, try as we might, we could not find that first doorway again. We\u2019d come through it in a blizzard. You are an old Arctic hand\u2014you know what that means. \u201cSo we had no choice but to stay in that new world. And we soon discovered what a dangerous place it was. It seemed that there was a strange kind of ghoul or apparition haunting it, something deadly and implacable. My two companions died soon afterward, victims of the Specters, as the things are called. \u201cThe result was that I found their world an abominable place, and I couldn\u2019t wait to leave it. The way back to my own world was barred forever. But there were other doorways into other worlds, and a little searching found the way into this. \u201cSo here I came. And I discovered a marvel as soon as I did, Mr. Scoresby, for worlds differ greatly, and in this world I saw my d\u00e6mon for the first time. Yes, I hadn\u2019t known of Sayan K\u00f6t\u00f6r here till I entered yours. People here cannot conceive of worlds where d\u00e6mons are a silent voice in the mind and no more. Can you imagine my astonishment,  in turn, at learning that part of my own nature was female, and bird-formed, and beautiful? \u201cSo with Sayan K\u00f6t\u00f6r beside me, I wandered through the northern lands, and I learned a good deal from the peoples of the Arctic, like my good friends in the village down there. What they told me of this world filled some gaps in the knowledge I\u2019d acquired in mine, and I began to see the answer to many mysteries. \u201cI made my way to Berlin under the name of Grumman. I told no one about my origins; it was my secret. I presented a thesis to the Academy, and defended it in debate, which is their method. I was better informed than the Academicians, and I had no difficulty in gaining membership. \u201cSo with my new credentials I could begin to work in this world, where I found myself, for the most part, greatly contented. I missed some things about my own world, to be sure. Are you a married man, Mr. Scoresby? No? Well, I was; and I loved my wife dearly, as I loved my son, my only child, a little boy not yet one year old when I wandered out of my world. I missed them terribly. But I might search for a thousand years and never find the way back. We were sundered forever. \u201cHowever, my work absorbed me. I sought other forms of knowledge; I was initiated into the skull cult; I became a shaman. And I have made some useful discoveries. I have found a way of making an ointment from bloodmoss, for example, that preserves all the virtues of the fresh plant. \u201cI know a great deal about this world now, Mr. Scoresby. I know, for example, about Dust. I see from your expression that you have heard the term. It is frightening your theologians to death, but they are the ones who frighten me. I know what Lord Asriel is doing, and I know why, and that\u2019s why I summoned you here. I am going to help him, you see, because the task he\u2019s undertaken is the greatest in human history. The greatest in thirty-five thousand years of human history, Mr. Scoresby. \u201cI can\u2019t do very much myself. My heart is diseased beyond the powers of anyone in this world to cure it. I have one great effort left in me, perhaps. But I know something Lord Asriel doesn\u2019t, something he needs to know if his effort is to succeed. \u201cYou see, I was intrigued by that haunted world where the Specters fed on human consciousness. I wanted to know what they were, how they had come into being. And as a shaman, I can discover things in the spirit where I cannot go in the body, and I spent much time in trance, exploring that world. I found that the philosophers there, centuries ago, had created a tool for their own undoing: an instrument they called the subtle knife. It had many powers\u2014more than they\u2019d guessed when they made it, far more than they know even now\u2014and somehow, in using it, they had let the Specters into their world. \u201cWell, I know about the subtle knife and what it can do. And I know where it is, and I know how to recognize the one who must use it, and I know what he must do in Lord Asriel\u2019s cause. I hope he\u2019s equal to the task. So I have summoned you here, and you are to fly me northward, into the world Asriel has opened, where I expect to find the bearer of the subtle knife. \u201cThat is a dangerous world, mind. Those Specters are worse than anything in your  world or mine. We shall have to be careful and courageous. I shall not return, and if you want to see your country again, you\u2019ll need all your courage, all your craft, all your luck. \u201cThat\u2019s your task, Mr. Scoresby. That is why you sought me out.\u201d",

Back long before humans,\u2019 he said, and his voice was soft and cracked and frail. \u201c \u2018Is it true that the greatest battle ever known is coming soon, Grandfather?\u2019 \u201c \u2018Yes, children,\u2019 he said. \u2018A greater battle than the last one, even. Fine feasting for all of us. These will be days of pleasure and plenty for every ghast in every world.\u2019 \u201c \u2018And who\u2019s going to win, Grandfather? Is Lord Asriel going to defeat the Authority?\u2019 \u201c \u2018Lord Asriel\u2019s army numbers millions,\u2019 the old cliff-ghast told them, \u2018assembled from every world. It\u2019s a greater army than the one that fought the Authority before, and it\u2019s better led. As for the forces of the Authority, why, they number a hundred times as many. But the Authority is age-old, far older even than me, children, and His troops are frightened, and complacent where they\u2019re not frightened. It would be a close fight, but Lord Asriel would win, because he is passionate and daring and he believes his cause is just. Except for one thing, children. He hasn\u2019t got \u00c6sah\u00e6ttr. Without \u00c6sah\u00e6ttr, he and all his forces will go down to defeat. And then we shall feast for years, my children!\u2019 \u201cAnd he laughed and gnawed the stinking old bone they\u2019d brought to him, and the others all shrieked with glee. \u201cNow, you can imagine how I listened hard to hear more about this \u00c6sah\u00e6ttr, but all I could hear over the howling of the wind was a young ghast asking, \u2018If Lord Asriel needs \u00c6sah\u00e6ttr, why doesn\u2019t he call him?\u2019 \u201cAnd the old ghast said, \u2018Lord Asriel knows no more about \u00c6sah\u00e6ttr than you do, child! That is the joke! Laugh long and loud\u2014\u2019 \u201cBut as I tried to get closer to the foul things to learn more, my power failed, sisters, I couldn\u2019t hold myself invisible any longer. The younger ones saw me and shrieked out, and I had to flee, back into this world through the invisible gateway in the air. A flock of them came after me, and those are the last of them, dead over there.  \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that Lord Asriel needs us, sisters. Whoever this \u00c6sah\u00e6ttr is, Lord Asriel needs us! I wish I could go back to Lord Asriel now and say, \u2018Don\u2019t be anxious\u2014we\u2019re coming\u2014we the witches of the north, and we shall help you win.\u2019 ... Let\u2019s agree now, Serafina Pekkala, and call a great council of all the witches, every single clan, and make war!\u201d",

Three times now I\u2019ve stepped in to pluck her out of danger. First, when the Oblation Board began its work: I went to Jordan College and I took her to live with me, in London, where I could keep her safe from the Board ... or so I hoped.
